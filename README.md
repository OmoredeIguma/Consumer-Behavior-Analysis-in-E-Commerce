# SPSS-PROJECT
# Overview
This project explores the E-commerce Customer Behaviour Dataset provided by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/e-commerce-customer-behavior-dataset). This dataset provides a comprehensive view of customer behavior within an e-commerce platform. Each entry in the dataset corresponds to a unique customer, offering a detailed breakdown of their interactions and transactions. The information is crafted to facilitate a nuanced analysis of customer preferences, engagement patterns, and satisfaction levels, aiding businesses in making data-driven decisions to enhance the customer experience. <br />

Objective 1: Descriptive statistics for the variables Age, Membership Type and Satisfaction Level. This was achieved with the use of frequency count, mean and percentages. <br />

Objective 2: Customer Segmentation (Cluster Analysis). This involved the use of hierarchical cluster analysis and K-Means Cluster Analysis. hierarchical cluster analysis was carried out to obtain the number of clusters to be use for the K-Means Cluster Analysis. <br />

Objective 3: Relationship Between Demographics and Spending (Chi-Square Test for Association). This was achieved with the use of chi-square test to examine if there is a significant relationship between gender and membership type. <br />

Objective 4: Analysis of Variance between variables total spend and age category. <br />

Objective 5: Customer Satisfaction Analysis (Chi-Square Test for Association). This involved the use of chi-square test to examine if there is a significant relationship between Stisfaction level and membership type. <br />

Objective 6: Effect of Discounts on Purchase Behaviour (t-test ) This was achieved with the use of t-test to compare the average total spend between customers who received a discount versus those who did not. <br />

Objective 7: Retention Analysis (Correlations). This involved the use of correlation anallysis to study the relationship between days since last purchase" and other variables like satisfaction level and membership type.

# Tools I Used
* IBM SPSS 26
* Microsoft Word <br />

# Hypothesis Testing
* Is there a significant association between gender and membership type? <br />
  H<sub>0</sub> : There is no significant difference between gender and membership type <br />
  H<sub>1</sub> : There is significant difference between gender and membership type.
* Is there a significant difference in the means for total spend and age category? <br />
 H<sub>0</sub> : The means are equal for total spend and age category  <br />
  H<sub>1</sub> : The means are different for total spend and age category  <br />

# Insights
Objective 1: From the descriptive statistics,Of the 3,900 samples, 24.2% of the customers were above the age 58, with a spending amount of under $60 at 50.9% and a review rating of between 4.0 - 4.9 at 40.4% <br />

Objective 2: From the K-means Cluster Analysis, 3 clusters were generated, with cluster 1 comprising of steady middle-age buyers. Cluster 2 comprises of young occasional buyers and cluster 3 consisting of old casual buyers. Cluster 1 had the most number of cases at 1,736 indicating  more prevalent customer segments. <br />

Objective 3: From the regression analysis, the variables age, iteam purchased, discount applied to product and previous purchases did not adquately explianed the variations in the dependent variable purhase amount with an r<sup>2</sup> of 2.3% and r <sub>adj</sub> of 0.01% <br />

Objective 4: From the Chi-Square test, the result shows if there's a significant association between the two categorical variables Promo Code Used and Discount Applied. The chi-square (Ï‡2) had a value of 3900 and _p_>0.05 and an effect size of 1.00 and a _p_>0.05 indictaing that there is a significant association between Promo Code Used and Discount Applied thus, we reject the null hyptothesis (H<sub>0</sub>) meaning people who use promo codes are more likely to have discounts applied. <br />

# SPSS-PROJECT
# Overview
This project explores the E-commerce Customer Behaviour Dataset provided by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/e-commerce-customer-behavior-dataset). This dataset provides a comprehensive view of customer behavior within an e-commerce platform. Each entry in the dataset corresponds to a unique customer, offering a detailed breakdown of their interactions and transactions. The information is crafted to facilitate a nuanced analysis of customer preferences, engagement patterns, and satisfaction levels, aiding businesses in making data-driven decisions to enhance the customer experience. <br />

Objective 1: Descriptive statistics for the variables Age, Membership Type and Satisfaction Level. This was achieved with the use of frequency count, mean and percentages. <br />

Objective 2: Customer Segmentation (Cluster Analysis). This involved the use of hierarchical cluster analysis and K-Means Cluster Analysis. hierarchical cluster analysis was carried out to obtain the number of clusters to be use for the K-Means Cluster Analysis. <br />

Objective 3: Relationship Between Demographics and Spending (Chi-Square Test for Association). This was achieved with the use of chi-square test to examine if there is a significant relationship between gender and membership type. <br />

Objective 4: Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) between variables total spend and age category. <br />

Objective 5: Customer Satisfaction Analysis (Chi-Square Test for Association). This involved the use of chi-square test to examine if there is a significant relationship between Stisfaction level and membership type. <br />

Objective 6: Effect of Discounts on Purchase Behaviour (t-test ) This was achieved with the use of t-test to compare the average total spend between customers who received a discount versus those who did not. <br />

Objective 7: Retention Analysis (Correlations). This involved the use of correlation anallysis to study the relationship between days since last purchase" and other variables like satisfaction level and membership type.

# Tools I Used
* IBM SPSS 26
* Microsoft Word <br />

# Hypothesis Testing
* Is there a significant association between gender and membership type? <br />
  H<sub>0</sub> : There is no significant difference between gender and membership type. <br />
  H<sub>1</sub> : There is significant difference between gender and membership type. <br />
  
* Is there a significant difference in the means for total spend and age category? <br />
  H<sub>0</sub> : The means are equal for total spend and age category.  <br />
  H<sub>1</sub> : The means are different for total spend and age category.  <br />

* Is there a significant difference between satisfaction level and membership type? <br />
  H<sub>0</sub> : There is no significant difference between satisfaction level and membership type. <br />
  H<sub>1</sub> : There is significant difference between satisfaction level and membership type. <br />

* Is there a significant difference between total spend and discount applied? <br />
   H<sub>0</sub> : There is no significant difference between total spend and discount applied.
   H<sub>1</sub> : There is significant difference between total spend and discount applied. <br />

* Is there a significant relationship between days since last purchase, membership type, and satisfaction level? <br />
   H<sub>0</sub> : No significant relationships between days since last purchase, membership type, and satisfaction level. <br />
   H<sub>1</sub> : Significant relationships between days since last purchase, membership type, and satisfaction level. <br />

# Insights
Objective 1: From the descriptive statistics, Of the 350 samples, 50% of the customers were at the age range 31-39, there were equal number of male and female, bronze, silver and gold membership subscribers were of spilt evenly(33.1%) (33.4%) and (33.4%) respectively. Majority of the customers were satisifed (35.7%) <br />

Objective 2: Four customer clusters were identified based on age, items purchased, and total spend:
* Cluster 1: Older customers (avg. age 32) with low spend.
* Cluster 2: Oldest customers (avg. age 39) with the lowest spend.
* Cluster 3: Slightly younger customers (avg. age 31) with moderate spend.
* Cluster 4: Youngest customers (avg. age 29) with the highest spend.
Younger customers tend to spend more; the company should focus promotions accordingly​ <br />

Objective 3: A significant relationship was found between gender and membership type. Female customers are more likely to have Bronze memberships, while males are more likely to have Gold memberships​ <br />

Objective 4: Customers under 30 spend significantly more ($1,176) compared to those aged 31–39 ($739) and those aged 40–46 ($500). Significant spending differences were found between all age groups​. <br />

Objective 5: Gold members are more likely to report satisfaction, while Bronze and Silver members report lower satisfaction levels. <br />

Objective 6: Customers who did not receive a discount spent significantly more ($903) compared to those who did receive a discount ($787). <br />

Objective 7: A negative correlation was found between days since last purchase and membership type, and a positive correlation between days since last purchase and satisfaction level​. <br />

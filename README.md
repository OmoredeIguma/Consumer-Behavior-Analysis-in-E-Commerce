# SPSS-PROJECT
# Overview
This project explores the E-commerce Customer Behaviour Dataset provided by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/e-commerce-customer-behavior-dataset). This dataset provides a comprehensive view of customer behavior within an e-commerce platform. Each entry in the dataset corresponds to a unique customer, offering a detailed breakdown of their interactions and transactions. The information is crafted to facilitate a nuanced analysis of customer preferences, engagement patterns, and satisfaction levels, aiding businesses in making data-driven decisions to enhance the customer experience. <br />
The transformed dataset used along with the raw SPSS output is presented above along with a results and discussions Word document presented in APA 7th edition format which goes in-depth into the findings.<br />

# Objectives
Objective 1: Descriptive statistics for the variables Age, Membership Type, and Satisfaction Level. This was achieved with the use of frequency count, mean, and percentages. <br />

Objective 2: Customer Segmentation (Cluster Analysis). This involved the use of hierarchical cluster analysis and K-Means Cluster Analysis. hierarchical cluster analysis was carried out to obtain the number of clusters to be used for the K-Means Cluster Analysis. <br />

Objective 3: Relationship Between Demographics and Spending (Chi-Square Test for Association). This was achieved with the use of a chi-square test to examine if there is a significant relationship between gender and membership type. <br />

Objective 4: Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) between variables total spend and age category. <br />

Objective 5: Customer Satisfaction Analysis (Chi-Square Test for Association). This involved the use of a chi-square test to examine if there is a significant relationship between satisfaction level and membership type. <br />

Objective 6: Effect of Discounts on Purchase Behaviour (t-test ) This was achieved with the use of a t-test to compare the average total spend between customers who received a discount versus those who did not. <br />

Objective 7: Retention Analysis (Correlations). This involved the use of correlation analysis to study the relationship between days since last purchase" and other variables like satisfaction level and membership type.

# Tools I Used
* IBM SPSS 26
* Microsoft Word <br />

# Hypothesis Testing
* Is there a significant association between gender and membership type? <br />
  H<sub>0</sub>: There is no significant difference between gender and membership type. <br />
  H<sub>1</sub>: There is a significant difference between gender and membership type. <br />
  
* Is there a significant difference in the means for total spending and age category? <br />
  H<sub>0</sub>: The means are equal for total spend and age category.  <br />
  H<sub>1</sub>: The means are different for total spending and age category.  <br />

* Is there a significant difference between satisfaction level and membership type? <br />
  H<sub>0</sub>: There is no significant difference between satisfaction level and membership type. <br />
  H<sub>1</sub>: There is a significant difference between satisfaction level and membership type. <br />

* Is there a significant difference between total spend and discount applied? <br />
   H<sub>0</sub>: There is no significant difference between total spend and discount applied.
   H<sub>1</sub>: There is a significant difference between total spend and discount applied. <br />

* Is there a significant relationship between days since the last purchase, membership type, and satisfaction level? <br />
   H<sub>0</sub>: No significant relationships between days since the last purchase, membership type, and satisfaction level. <br />
   H<sub>1</sub>: Significant relationships between days since last purchase, membership type, and satisfaction level. <br />

# Insights
Objective 1: From the descriptive statistics, Of the 348 samples, 49.7% of the customers were of the age range 31-39, and there were a close number of males and females (50.3%) and (49.7%) respectively, bronze, silver, and gold membership subscribers were split evenly(32.8%) (33.6%) and (33.6%) respectively. The majority of the customers were satisfied (35.9%) <br />

Objective 2: Four customer clusters were identified based on age, items purchased, and total spending:
* Cluster 1: Older customers (avg. age 32) with low spending.
* Cluster 2: Oldest customers (avg. age 39) with the lowest spend.
* Cluster 3: Slightly younger customers (avg. age 31) with moderate spending.
* Cluster 4: Youngest customers (avg. age 29) with the highest spend.
Younger customers tend to spend more; the company should focus promotions accordingly​ <br />

Objective 3: A significant relationship was found between gender and membership type. Female customers are more likely to have Bronze memberships, while males are more likely to have Gold memberships​ <br />

Objective 4: Customers under 30 spend significantly more ($1,176.17) compared to those aged 31–39 ($742.35) and those aged 40–46 ($499.88). Significant spending differences were found between all age groups. <br />

Objective 5: Gold members are more likely to report satisfaction, while Bronze and Silver members report lower satisfaction levels. <br />

Objective 6: Customers who did not receive a discount spent significantly more ($909.01) compared to those who did receive a discount ($787.27). <br />

Objective 7: A negative correlation was found between days since the last purchase and membership type and a positive correlation between days since the last purchase and satisfaction level. <br />

# Hypothesis Test Results
 * Is there a significant association between gender and membership type? <br />
  Based on the chi-square test, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there was a signification association between gender and membership type <br />

* Is there a significant difference in the means for total spending and age category?
  From the ANOVA result, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the means for total spending and age category were different. <br />
  
* Is there a significant association between satisfaction level and membership type?
  We reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there was a significant association between satisfaction level and membership type. <br />
  
* Is there a significant difference between total spend and discount applied?
  The null hypothesis was rejected based on the t-test result, indicating that there was a significant difference between total spending and discount applied. <br />
  
* Is there a significant relationship between days since the last purchase, membership type, and satisfaction level?
  From the correlation analysis, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there was a significant relationship between days since the last purchase, membership type, and satisfaction level.

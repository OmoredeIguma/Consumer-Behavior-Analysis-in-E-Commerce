# SPSS-PROJECT
# Overview
This project explores the Consumer Behavior and Shopping Habits Dataset provided by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zeesolver/consumer-behavior-and-shopping-habits-dataset). It is a collection of consumer information crucial for market analysis and tailored marketing strategies. It covers Customer IDs for identification, Age and Gender for demographics, and Purchase Amount in USD for transaction value. Details like Item Purchased, Category, and Location provide insights into product preferences and regional trends. Size, Color, and Season data cater to specific consumer choices.<br />

Objective 1: Descriptive statistics for the variables Age, Purchase Amount and Review Ratings. This involved the use of frequency count, mean, standard deviation and percentages. <br />

Objective 2: Customer Segmentation (Cluster Analysis). This involved the use of hierarchical cluster analysis and K-Means Cluster Analysis. hierarchical cluster analysis was carried out to obtain the number of clusters to be use for the K-Means Cluster Analysis. <br />

Objective 3: Predictive Modeling (Linear Regression) Determinations of the factors influencing the Purchase Amount variables. <br />

Objective 4: Association Analysis (Chi-Square Test) Determination of the relationship between the categorical variables Promo Code Used and Discount Applied. <br />

# Tools I Used
* IBM SPSS 26
* Microsoft Word <br />

# Hypothesis Testing
* Is there a significant difference in total spend based on customer segments (e.g., age, frequency of purchase, previous purchases)? <br />
  H<sub>0</sub> : There is no significant difference in total spend based on customer segments <br />
  H<sub>1</sub> : There is significant difference in total spend based on customer segments
* Is there a significant association in promo code used and discount applied? <br />
 H<sub>0</sub> : There is no significant association in promo code used and discount applied <br />
  H<sub>1</sub> : There is significant association in promo code used and discount applied  <br />

# Insights
Objective 1: From the descriptive statistics,Of the 3,900 samples, 24.2% of the customers were above the age 58, with a spending amount of under $60 at 50.9% and a review rating of between 4.0 - 4.9 at 40.4% <br />

Objective 2: From the K-means Cluster Analysis, 3 clusters were generated, with cluster 1 comprising of steady middle-age buyers. Cluster 2 comprises of young occasional buyers and cluster 3 consisting of old casual buyers. Cluster 1 had the most number of cases at 1,736 indicating  more prevalent customer segments. <br />

Objective 3: From the regression analysis, the variables age, iteam purchased, discount applied to product and previous purchases did not adquately explianed the variations in the dependent variable purhase amount with an r<sup>2</sup> of 2.3% and r <sub>adj</sub> of 0.01% <br />

Objective 4: From the Chi-Square test, the result shows if there's a significant association between the two categorical variables Promo Code Used and Discount Applied. The chi-square (Ï‡2) had a value of 3900 and _p_>0.05 and an effect size of 1.00 and a _p_>0.05 indictaing that there is a significant association between Promo Code Used and Discount Applied thus, we reject the null hyptothesis (H<sub>0</sub>) meaning people who use promo codes are more likely to have discounts applied. <br />
